    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the recipe that my friends and family
        still beg me to make when the grill is brought
         out. It's so easy and versatile, and can be 
         tried on several different meats. I like it 
         with scalloped potatoes, baked potatoes or 
         rice pilaf. Try it with cilantro or oregano 
         instead of parsley. Save leftovers for salad 
         the next day.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.
</li>

        <li>
            Dip chicken in lemon juice, and sprinkle with the onion powder, ground black pepper, seasoning salt and parsley. Discard any remaining lemon juice.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cook on the prepared grill 10 to 15 minutes per side, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
        </li>
    </ol>
